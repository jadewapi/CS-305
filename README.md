# Portfolio Artifact: Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report

## Client Summary
**Client:** Artemis Financial  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required robust data security for sensitive financial information. They needed a software solution that could withstand common cyber threats and ensure secure data transmission. My task was to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within the software to protect it against potential security breaches.

## Strengths in Identifying Security Vulnerabilities
In assessing and securing Artemis Financial's software, I employed industry-standard tools and best practices to effectively identify security vulnerabilities. My approach balanced automated scans with manual review, capturing both major vulnerabilities and subtle potential risks. Secure coding is essential because it safeguards client data and builds trust in the companyâ€™s systems. Overall, secure coding practices add immense value to a business by preventing breaches, maintaining regulatory compliance, and protecting the company's reputation.

## Challenges and Insights Gained
A challenging aspect of the assessment was managing dependencies, particularly in distinguishing real threats from false positives. This experience taught me how to prioritize issues based on severity, enhancing my ability to make informed security decisions in a fast-paced environment.

## Layered Security and Future Techniques
To increase security layers, I implemented HTTPS to ensure encrypted data transmission. Moving forward, I would use OWASP tools and advanced static analysis tools for vulnerability assessment and would select mitigation techniques based on the specific threat levels and needs of the application.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security Post-Refactoring
After refactoring, I performed comprehensive functional and security testing, including dependency checks and vulnerability scans. This process confirmed that no new vulnerabilities were introduced, ensuring a secure and stable application.

## Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices for Future Use
Key resources and tools included OWASP Dependency-Check for analyzing dependencies, AES for encryption, and SHA-256 for data integrity verification. These will be instrumental in future assignments and projects.

## Value to Future Employers
This artifact demonstrates my ability to perform vulnerability assessments and apply secure coding practices. I can present this work to future employers to showcase my skills in securing software applications, maintaining data integrity, and addressing security issues systematically.
